To a hacker, "computer" means shell. The shell is to a hacker what a katan is to a samurai. It's a captain's ship, a jedi's lightsaber, a magician's bag of tricks. The shell is important beacuse of what your read in Chapter 2 of "The Art of Unix Programming": modularity. Hacking is the ability to create necessary tools from existing tools quickly and on the fly, and a Unix shell is the best way to do this.

Consider making hot chocolate. You could boil some water, add hot chocolate powder, mix, and then you have hot chocolate. Or you could mix 1/2 heavy whipping cream with 1/2 milk. Slowly simmer until just below boiling point. Add some unsweetened dark chocolate and a pinch of salt. Mix slowly with a wooden spoon and serve immediately. The hot chocolate mix is easier to learn but cooking from ingredients gets you a tastier product. More importantly, cooking from ingredients you can make anything. The cream can be used for Indian curry, the milk for cheese, the chocolate can be eaten alone and the salt can add flavor to any dish. Hot cocoa powder serves only one function. However, learning to cook from ingredients requires an up-front investment in the skill of cooking.

The Unix shell is the same way. Instead of large complicated programs that perform a specific task, it provides vertitile ingredients that can be mixed and matched as necessary. However, cooking has one drawback that programming does not. If you write a good enough recipe, Unix can do all the work for you, and you can go on to writing better recipes.

You'll remember that "Introduction to Linux" introducted you two two text editors: emacs and vi(m). These are the two best text editors in the universe, each serving a slightly different purpose. Vi(m) is a way to edit files through the shell whereas emacs is an Integrated Development Environmen. For now, we'll use vim because it integrates better with the shell. We'll get back to emacs later.
